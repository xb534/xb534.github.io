<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>
From 2022 to January 2025, I pursued my Master's degree at the School of Electrical and Information Engineering, Tianjin University, under the supervision of Associate Prof. [Jiale Cao](https://jialecao001.github.io/).

Since January 2025, I have been working as a Researcher in the Foundation Model Group at MEGVII Technology.

My research interests primarily focus on three areas: (1) **Embodied AI**, (2) **Video Generation**, and (3) **Autonomous Driving**.

<!-- From 2023 to Jan. 2025, I am a research intern at Foundation model group in MEGVII Technology, supervised by [Tiancai Wang](https://scholar.google.com.hk/citations?user=YI0sRroAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN) and [Yingfei Liu](https://scholar.google.com.hk/citations?user=pF9KA1sAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN). -->

Multi-Query and Multi-Level Enhanced Network for Semantic Segmentation
|**Pattern Recognition**|[Paper](https://xb534.github.io/)|[Code](https://github.com/xb534/QLSeg)|

**Bin Xie**, Jiale Cao, Rao Muhammad Anwer, Jin Xie, Jing Nie, Aiping Yang, Yanwei Pang

- <strong style="color:green"> To address the limitations of current single-query designs, which fail to fully exploit the diverse, multi-level information available in plain Vision Transformers (ViT), we propose a multi-query and multi-level enhanced network for semantic segmentation.</strong>
