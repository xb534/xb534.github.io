<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>
From 2022 to January 2025, I pursued my Master's degree at the School of Electrical and Information Engineering, Tianjin University, under the supervision of Associate Prof. [Jiale Cao](https://jialecao001.github.io/).

Since January 2025, I have been working as a Researcher in the Foundation Model Group at MEGVII Technology. We are hiring research interns all year round, please feel free to drop me your resume at bin_xie@tju.edu.cn.

My research interests primarily focus on three areas: (1) **Embodied AI**, (2) **Video Generation**, and (3) **Autonomous Driving**.

GeoVLA: Empowering 3D Representations in Vision-Language-Action Models
|[Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09071)|[Demo](https://linsun449.github.io/GeoVLA/)

Lin Sun, **Bin Xie**, Yingfei Liu, Hao Shi, Tiancai Wang, Jiale Cao

- <strong style="color:green"> GeoVLA is a vision-language-action framework that integrates 3D geometry for better robotic manipulation. It fuses image-language data with point cloud features to enhance spatial awareness, achieving state-of-the-art performance and robustness in simulation and real-world tasks. </strong>

Multi-Query and Multi-Level Enhanced Network for Semantic Segmentation
|**Pattern Recognition**|[Paper](https://xb534.github.io/)|[Code](https://github.com/xb534/QLSeg)|

**Bin Xie**, Jiale Cao, Rao Muhammad Anwer, Jin Xie, Jing Nie, Aiping Yang, Yanwei Pang

- <strong style="color:green"> To address the limitations of current single-query designs, which fail to fully exploit the diverse, multi-level information available in plain Vision Transformers (ViT), we propose a multi-query and multi-level enhanced network for semantic segmentation.</strong>
